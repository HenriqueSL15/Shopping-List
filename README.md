# *Shopping list*

## What is this project?
In this project I created a website that allows you to add items to a list according to your needs. And all added items are saved in a database.

## What was the purpose?
The purpose of this project was to learn how to use a NoSQL database (MongoDB), in addition to learning about how to integrate a RESTful API (and its importance)

## Technologies used:
<ul>
   <li>Javascript</li>
   <li>Typescript</li>
   <li>React</li>
   <li>MongoDB (NoSQL)</li>
   <li>Express.js</li>
   <li>Axios.js</li>  
</ul>

## Where can I test?

**First**, download the project, extract it and then open the primary folder ( the folder containing 2 others folders: server and shopping-list) with Visual Studio Code.
   
**Second**, create 2 terminals. On the first one, run:
   
> cd shopping-list

And then:

> npm run dev

*This will run the project( the client side)*

**Third**, on the second terminal, run:

>cd server

And then:

>npm start

This will run the server side.

**Now everything is working right :D, just open the blue link that showed up on the first terminal and you can use the website**
